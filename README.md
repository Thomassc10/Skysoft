Skysoft improves everyday SkyBlock gameplay with inventory tools, market tracking, interface customization, and other focused utilities. It draws inspiration from projects such as [SkyHanni](https://modrinth.com/mod/skyhanni) and [Firmament](https://modrinth.com/mod/firmament).

## Main Features

### Item List

Browse SkyBlock items, recipes, usages, obtain sources, and market data directly from inventory screens. Search the catalog, explore Crafting, Forge, and Kat recipes, inspect Bazaar history and order depth, and create waypoints to relevant NPCs.

### Bazaar Tracker

Follow Bazaar order progress in real time without repeatedly opening the Bazaar. Filling estimates approximate how much of each order has completed, while Flipping Mode tracks total or per-session profit.
